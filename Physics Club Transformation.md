## Introduction
Physics club is happy to announce some drastic changes that are going down. Please see below for details, but from here on in, physics club is not just a study room for physics. It is becoming an active, weekly-activity club like every other club at BT.

The club will now be hosting **_STEM leadership, community-service activities, and 
networking opportunities._** Please see below for details.

## BT’s Physics Club is create Zavcademy.org for NJCTL
Our club is creating an online database with digital tutoring videos and tutorials for the AP/NJCTL Physics Packets/Questions & Curriculum. Similar to Khan Academy, this will be a platform for physics study videos and resources. It will include tutorials on the free response problems, AP questions, multiple choice, and the chapter lessons.

This is an enormous project. We will be institutionalizing this, hopefully with NJCTL’s help, and expanding it to other schools. If you want to contribute to the videos or media component (marketing), please follow up as we have open positions. 

The site will be running by May (before APs).

## Tutoring

We are planning a physics class student/tutor system. We all know that physics is a really, really hard subject to learn. It's troublesome to have to go to your teacher every time you have a question about anything. What's even worse is you have to find a time you are free, then check if that teacher is free, before being able to ask them questions. And even then, sometimes that teacher refers you to another teacher. Happens to me all the time.

Those who have mastered physics are allowed to be a tutor, and in doing so, will also get volunteer hours. You know how the tutoring system the guidance counselors use? It's basically that, a tutor will be assigned a student and said tutor can help the student out, answer their questions, etc.

That right, during your free times, you can get volunteer hours!

So what do I have to be in order to be a tutor?

- Enough commitment to be able to tutor what you are assigned (don't worry the schedule is very flexible)
- At least an A- in physics your current physics class
- Currently be in a physics class
- Be at least one year older than the class you are teaching
